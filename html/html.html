<h1>Platelet Counts Calculation</h1>

<p>The blood platelet counts of a group of women are assumed to follow a bell-shaped distribution with a mean (\(\mu\)) and a standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) given as follows:</p>

<p>\[
\mu = 247.1 \quad \text{(mean)}
\]</p>

<p>\[
\sigma = 67.5 \quad \text{(standard deviation)}
\]</p>

<p>Using the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule), we can approximate the percentage of women with platelet counts within certain ranges.</p>

<h2>Range A</h2>

<p>We want to find the approximate percentage of women with platelet counts within 1 standard deviation of the mean, or between \(179.6 \times 10^3\) and \(314.6 \times 10^3\) cells/\(\mu L\).</p>

<p>To calculate this, we use the empirical rule, which states that approximately 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean for a bell-shaped distribution.</p>

<p>Therefore, the approximate percentage of women with platelet counts within range A is 68.20%.</p>

<p>The following Python code demonstrates how to calculate the approximate percentage within range A:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import numpy as np

mean = 247.1
std_dev = 67.5
range_a = (179.6, 314.6)

def calculate_percentage_within_range(data, range_values):
    within_range = len([x for x in data if range_values[0] <= x <= range_values[1]]) / len(data)
    return within_range

np.random.seed(42)
sample_size = 10000
platelet_counts = np.random.normal(mean, std_dev, sample_size)

percentage_within_range_a = calculate_percentage_within_range(platelet_counts, range_a)

print("Approximate percentage within range A: {:.2%}".format(percentage_within_range_a))
</code></pre>

<h2>Range B</h2>

<p>We want to find the approximate percentage of women with platelet counts between \(44.6 \times 10^3\) and \(449.6 \times 10^3\) cells/\(\mu L\).</p>

<p>To calculate this, we use the empirical rule again. Since the range specified is beyond 2 standard deviations from the mean, the percentage is not directly provided by the empirical rule. However, we can make an approximation by considering that approximately 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean for a bell-shaped distribution.</p>

<p>Therefore, the approximate percentage of women with platelet counts within range B is approximately 99.72%.</p>

<p>The following Python code demonstrates how to calculate the approximate percentage within range B:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
range_b = (44.6, 449.6)

percentage_within_range_b = calculate_percentage_within_range(platelet_counts, range_b)

print("Approximate percentage within range B: {:.2%}".format(percentage_within_range_b))
</code></pre>
